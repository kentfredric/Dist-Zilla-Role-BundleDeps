Dist::Zilla::Role::BundleDeps

This role attempts to solve the problem of communicating dependencies to
META.* from bundles in a different way.

My first attempt was "[Prereqs::Plugins]", which added all values that
are seen in the "dist.ini" to dependencies.

However, that was inherently limited, as the ":version" specifier is
lost before the plugins appear on "$zilla->plugins"

This Role however, can see any declarations of ":version" your bundle
advertises, by standing between your "bundle_config" method and
"Dist::Zilla"
